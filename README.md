# Market-Basket-Analysis-Recommender---Product-Based-Filtering
The notebook starts off with data processing, followed by exploratory data analysis. Different aspects were explored that helped me make deductions about the store. For instance, I came to knoe which hour of day, day of the week and month of year were the busiest for the store. Also, the net sales, most quatitities sold, and most frequently sold of the top5 were visualized.  EDA was followed by Market Basket Analysis using association analysis. This is a technique typically used to find which products are brought together using support, confidence and lift metrics. The algorithm that makes it easier to calculate is apriori.  Then the coocurance matrix technique was used to find the products that most frquently brought together. Finally an item based collaborative filter recommender was created and was tested on a customer.
